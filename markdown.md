This bot's focused on being a life simulator!

#### Before everything...
Check ***d!tutorial***! There's a **full usage guide** that goes through  
everything. You can use ***d!help***  for a list of all commands, or  
***d!help [command]*** for a detailed description of a specific command.


### Interact with other players

Choose a interaction and use it with another user by doing  
***d![action-name] @[user]***! It'll work even if you one of you  
haven't created a character. Check the full list of interactions  
above, or using ***d!social***.

* **Over 30 different interactions**
* **More than 400 handpicked gifs**
* **Friendship and romance points!**

DeltaLife has an enormous library of gifs made available, for the  
users through many different interaction commands, separated  
between friendly, mean or romantic actions

You can keep track of your relationship with other players, as you  
gain friendship or romance with each other through playing.  
You can also get married or even get pregnant from other players!

Each interaction gives (or takes from) you and the other player  
different *friend* or *love* values. Interaction enough times, you'll  
get a title (like *friends*, *rivals* or *lovebirds*)! You can keep track  
on all of that using ***d!relation @[user]***.


### Live your virtual life
###### these aren't all the commands

* **A big total of 52 commands**

character, with which you'll do everything! Check the aforementioned  
***d!tutorial*** for a how to live your character's life, step by step.

With DeltaLife, you can create your own character and live his life,

#### Footnote about permissions...
					
*MANAGE_MESSAGES* is required ONLY to allow for the eventual deletion of  
command messages (to keep everything clean) or the bot's own messages.

*EMBED_LINKS* is there cause most command responses make use of  
embeds (some of them including images).

*ATTACH_FILES* is required for only one specific command, which responses  
includes a script-generated image that can only be sent by attaching  
it to the message.

*ADD_REACTIONS* is there for many commands that require user input.  
Other than that, sometimes you'll need to navigate between embeds,  
that's only possible with reactions.
